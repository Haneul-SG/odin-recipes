    <h2><strong>All About This Delicious Korean Staple Dish</strong></h2>
    <p1><strong>Bulgogi,</strong>pronounced as <em>bool-goh-gi</em>is literally "fire meat", is a gui (구이; Korean-style grilled or roasted dish) made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin, rib eye or brisket are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish.</p1>
    <p2>The dish originated from northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, but is a very popular dish in South Korea, where it can be found anywhere from upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.</p2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 Pounds of boneless ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1/2 Small peeled and grated pear</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup of reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Korean Red Pepper Paste</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 Thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wrap steak in plastic wrap, and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Unwrap and slice across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine pear, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger and gochujang. In a gallon size Ziploc bag, combine soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate for at least 2 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat.* Working in batches, add steak to the grill pan in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until charred and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and steak.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
