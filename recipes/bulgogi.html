    <h2><strong>All About This Delicious Korean Staple Dish</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Bulgogi,</strong>pronounced as <em>bool-goh-gi</em>is literally "fire meat", is a gui (구이; Korean-style grilled or roasted dish) made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin, rib eye or brisket are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish.</p>
    <p>The dish originated from northern areas of the Korean Peninsula, but is a very popular dish in South Korea, where it can be found anywhere from upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.</p>
