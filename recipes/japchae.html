    <h2><strong>All About This Delicious Korean Side Dish</strong></h2>
    <p1><strong>Japchae,</strong>pronounced as <em>jahp-jae</em>is is a savory and slightly sweet dish of stir-fried glass noodles and vegetables that is popular in Korean cuisine.[1] Japchae is typically prepared with dangmyeon (당면, 唐麵), a type of cellophane noodles made from sweet potato starch; the noodles are mixed with assorted vegetables, meat, mushrooms, and seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil.</p1>
    <p2>Once a royal dish, japchae is now one of the most popular traditional celebration dishes, often served on special occasions, such as weddings, birthdays (especially dol, the first birthday, and hwangap, the sixtieth), and holidays.[6][5][7] It is also popular at banquets, parties, and potlucks, due to the ease of bulk preparation and flexible serving: japchae can be served warm, at room temperature, or cold from the refrigerator, and can be eaten freshly made or the day after.</p2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>4 Ounces of Beef cut into 1/4 inch wide and 2.5 inch long strips</li>
        <li>2 Large dried shiitake mushrooms soaked in warm water</li>
        <li>2 Minced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons of sugar</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 Large egg</li>
        <li>4 Ounces of washed and drained spinach</li>
        <li>24 Ounces of sweet potato starch noodles</li>
        <li>3 2" Crosswise cut green onions</li>
        <li>1 Thinly sliced medium onion</li>
        <li>5 Thinly sliced white mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 Thinly sliced medium carrot</li>
        <li>1/2 Thinly sliced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Marinate the Beef and Mushrooms</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the beef and shiitake mushrooms into a bowl and mix with 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 teaspoon sugar, ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, 2 teaspoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of toasted sesame oil with a wooden spoon or by hand.</li>
        <li>Cover and keep it in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the Egg Garnish</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the egg and separate the egg yolk from the egg white. Remove the white stringy stuff (chalaza) from the yolk. Beat in a pinch of salt with a fork.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to a heated nonstick pan. Swirl the oil around so it covers the pan, and then wipe off the excess heated oil with a kitchen towel so only a thin layer remains on the pan.</li>
        <li>To keep the jidan as yellow as possible, turn off the heat and pour the egg yolk mixture into the pan. Tilt it around so the mixture spreads thinly. Let it cook using the remaining heat in the pan for about 1 minute. Flip it over and let it sit on the pan for 1 more minute.</li>
        <li>Let it cool and slice it into thin strips.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Noodles and Vegetables</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the spinach and blanch for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then take it out with a slotted spoon or strainer. Let the water keep boiling to cook the noodles.</li>
        <li>Rinse the spinach in cold water to stop it from cooking. Squeeze it with your hands to remove any excess water. Cut it a few times and put it into a bowl. Mix with 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil. Put it into a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Put the noodles into the boiling water, cover and cook for 1 minute. Stir them with a wooden spoon so they don’t stick together. Cover and keep cooking for another 7 minutes until the noodles are soft and chewy.</li>
        <li>Strain and cut them a few times with kitchen scissors. Put the noodles into the large bowl next to the spinach. Add 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Mix well by hand or a wooden spoon. This process will season the noodles and also keep the noodles from sticking to each other.</li>
        <li>Heat up a skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil with the onion, the green onion, and a pinch of salt. Stir-fry about 2 minutes until the onion looks a little translucent. Transfer to the noodle bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat up the skillet again and add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil. Add the white mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Stir-fry for 2 minutes until softened and a little juicy. Transfer to the noodle bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat up the skillet and add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Add the carrot and stir-fry for 20 seconds. Add the red bell pepper strips and stir-fry another 20 seconds. Transfer to the noodle bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat up the skillet and add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil. Add the beef and mushroom mixture and stir fry for a few minutes until the beef is no longer pink and the mushrooms are softened and shiny. Transfer to the noodle bowl.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Mix and Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 1 minced garlic clove, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sugar, ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, and 2 teaspoons of toasted sesame oil to the mixing bowl full of ingredients. Mix all together by hand.</li>
        <li>Add the egg garnish and 1 tablespoon sesame seeds. Mix it and transfer it to a large plate and serve.</li>
    </ol>
